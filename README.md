# RoCPMailer

RoCPMailer(Rise of civilization Personal Mailer) Is a Program used for automating Mails. (Having the Program automatically send a given message to Alliances, The Kingdom And even other singular users). 

# How does it work? 

RoCPMailer works by acting as a user to send Mails. 

# How does it acts as a user? 

RoCPmailer will rely on an AI which will have the ability to auto touch and directly connect to an ID. 

# How to set it up? 

Install rdmd & g++ on your Device. 
Clone your current Rise of civilization Game. 
Git clone this repository. 
And Run the Program. 

To run the program put `g++ -c Mailer.cpp  dmd Mailer.d User.d RoCPMailer.o && ./RoCMailer `

# How will this work? 
Once you install rdmd & g++ on your Device and run the Program(if you cloned Your RoC game) RoCPmailer Will automatically detect if the Package Changed. (The way Cloning an app works is if the Package of the app was changed.) And RoCPMailer. Will detect the change and will start to run on the cloned RoC game.

# How to send messages? 

Instructions are in Mailer.d file.
